## Introducing Probability

### Preface

> [It is] notable that the Feynman lectures (3 volumes) write about all of physics in 1800 pages, using only 2
levels of hierarchical headings: chapters and A-level heads in the text. It also uses the methodology of sentences
which then cumulate sequentially into paragraphs, rather than the grunts of bullet points. Undergraduate Caltech physics
is very complicated material, but it didn’t require an elaborate hierarchy to organize. <footer> - Quoter </footer>

## Sidenotes: Footnotes and Marginal Notes

Superscript: 19^th^

One of the most distinctive features of Tufte’s style is his extensive use of sidenotes.This is a sidenote. Sidenotes
 are like footnotes, except they don’t force the reader to jump their eye to the bottom of the page, but instead
 display off to the side in the margin. Perhaps you have noticed their use in this document already. You are very astute.
