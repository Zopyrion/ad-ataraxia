# Tufte Styled Blog

This is a React blog template based on Dave Liepmann's [Tufte-css](https://edwardtufte.github.io/tufte-css/) with
support for markdown. Easily write in a human readable text file and let the template convert your markdown to
a clean and elegant web page.



## Usage
Configure settings in /src/config.txt.

Write markdown'd text in a file and place it under ```/src/posts/```. Look at ```sample.txt``` as an example.

Run ``` npm start```.

## Markdown usage

The first letter of the first paragraph in a section has special formatting.

Three equal marks denote a new section.
```
> ≡≡≡
```

# This is a top level heading
```
> #This is a top level heading
```

## This is a second level heading
```
> ## This is a second level heading
```

### This is a third level heading
```
> ### This is a third level heading
```

#### This is a forth level heading
```
> #### This is a forth level heading
```

Code blocks are surrounded by tildes.
```
```function f(x)```
```

Superscripts can be used with the caret: 8^th^
```
> 8^th^
```

Cite sources using the \@ symbol.
@Myself@
```
> A statement.
> @Source@
```

Quotes are very cool!
>To thine own self be true. <footer> - Hamlet, Act 1 Scene 3 </footer>
```
> Quote. <foooter>  -Quoter </footer>
```

Links to another site are useful.
[Click here to go to somewhere.](https://google.com)
```
> [Click here to go to somewhere.](https://google.com)
```

<br/><br/><br/>
br tags can provide additional spacing if needed.
```
> <br/><br/><br/>
```
